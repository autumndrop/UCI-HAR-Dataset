# UCI-HAR-Dataset
Course project of the course "Getting and Cleaning Data" 

General Description about the Files:
There are three files in the repository:
'CodeBook.md' describes all the variables and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information in the tidy data set generated by step 5.
'run_analysis.R': R script which does the following: 
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
'README.md' gives a general desciption what is done.
